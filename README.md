# Advanced Motor Drive Sensing System (AMDS)

The AMDS is a hardware platform for sensing parameters such as currents and voltages in power electronic systems. 
The platform includes

-  Sensor cards to measure low voltage, high voltage, and currents.
-  A mainboard that serves as a carrier board for upto 8 sensor cards.
-  SPI interface between the sensor cards and the mainboard.
-  Robust differential IO communication to transmit sensor data to an external controller such as the [AMDC](https://amdc.dev/).

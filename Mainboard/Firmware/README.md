# Mainboard Firmware

The "mainboard" is part of the SensorCard platform. It can hold up to eight daughter cards, each of which contain a SPI ADC device. These ADCs are then sampled by the mainboard's MCU. The ADC samples are transmitted back to the AMDC so control algorithms can make use of the extra analog inputs. Several daughter card designs exist:

1. Current sense
2. High Voltage sense (for bus voltage levels)
3. Low Voltage sense (for +/- 10V levels)

This folder houses all the files needed to build the firmware which runs on the MCU on the mainboard PCB.

## Required Tools

To easily build this firmware and load it onto a mainboard, please install the following software on your host PC:

- [STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) -- the latest version is fine.

This tool is analogous to the Xilinx SDK tool (for the AMDC). It is effectively the Eclipse IDE but with customizations from ST. You can write all the C code here, compile it, flash the MCU, debug, etc.

## Development Steps

To develop code for STM32 processors:

#### Generating New Projects

1. Use the STM32CubeIDE to generate a new project
2. When configuring this project, select the exact MCU device which you are targetting (the mainboard uses `STM32F765ZGT6`)
3. Open the CubeMX perspective (i.e. `*.ioc` file) and configure all desired peripherals (SPIs, UARTs, ETH, etc)
4. Change to the clock configuration tab and use the GUI to configure the PLL settings
5. Generate initialization code to boot-strap your project. This will configure the clock and peripherals like you specified.

#### Writing Code

6. Now that you have a base project, write all your application-specific code...

#### Testing / Debugging Code

7. Use the IDE to compile your code and ensure there are no errors.
8. To flash the hardware, plug in a SWD debugger device to your PC + board (highly recommend [`STLINK-V3SET`](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/stmicroelectronics/STLINK-V3SET/497-18216-ND/9636028))
9. Configure a debug session in the IDE
10. Run the debug sessions. This will flash the MCU and start the code (probably breakpoint at `main()`)

NOTE: The STM32 devices are typically programmed into non-volatile memory. Therefore, there is no seperate "flashing" step. Every time you upload code, it is permanantely stored on the processor. You can power cycle the device and your code will start running again.

## Mainboard Firmware Design

The mainboard firmware is fairly simple, yet very specialized for the application. Before changing *anything* in the code, make sure you understand how it works. Practically every line of the code is optimized for speed and efficiency! Using a multi-channel logic analyzer / oscilloscope is absolutely required when updating the mainboard firmware to validate code timing.

**Do not blindly change the code.**

## Flashing Firmware to Mainboards with Alternative STM32F745ZG Processors

The firmware project provided in this repository is configured for a mainboard populated with a STM32F**765**ZG processor. This project configuration is incompatible with the alternative STM32F**745**ZG chip that is populated on some mainboard PCBs. Creating a new project targeting the alternative STM32F**745**ZG processor and loading in the provided source files is required. Here's how that's done.

### Create a new STM32 Project
1. Within STM32CubeIDE create a new `STM32 project` targeting the `STM32F745ZG` device with the following settings:
    - Targeted Language: `C`
    - Targeted Binary Type: `Executable`
    - Targeted Project Type: `STM32Cube`

### Replace Source Code
2. Open the file folder location of the newly created project 
3. Navigate to the `\Core\` directory and replace the `\Src` & `\Inc` folders with the ones provided in the AMDS repository
4. Navigate to the `\Drivers\STM32F7xx_HAL_Driver` directory and replace the `\Src` & `\Inc` folders with the ones provided in the AMDS repository
5. Within STM32CubeIDE refresh & build the project, no errors should be present

### Increase Compiler Optimization
6. In the `Project Explorer` pane on the left, right-click on the STM32Cube Project you created, and click on Properties
7. Expand `C/C++ Build` and click `Settings`
8. Find and click on `MCU GCC Compiler` > `Optimization`
9. Select the dropdown next for `Optimization Level` and change to `Optimize more (-O2)`
10. Select `Apply and Close`

### Flash Firmware to Mainboard
11. Select `Debug Configurations` under the `Run` menu at the top
12. Select the `Debugger` tab in the pop-up window
13. Change the `Frequency (kHz)` setting from `Auto` to `140`
14. Select `Apply` 

You are now ready to connect & flash the firmware to the STM32F**745**ZG processor equiped Mainboard!
